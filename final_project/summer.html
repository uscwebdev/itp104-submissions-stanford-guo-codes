                        <p>
                            Blueberries are by the far most 
                            profitable crop during the summer. 
                            Purchasable from Pierre for 80 gold 
                            per seed, each blueberry plant will 
                            generate an average of 20.8 gold per 
                            day as each blueberry plant is capable 
                            of producing up to 3 blueberries per 
                            harvest. What more could you possibly 
                            want?

                            Available at night from 6pm to 2am at 
                            the ocean, the purple, elusive, super 
                            cucumber is by far the most profitable 
                            fish (if you can even call it that) you 
                            can catch during the summer. They are at 
                            least worth 250 gold per super cucumber, 
                            and although they are extremely difficult 
                            to catch, the profit you generate from each 
                            super cucumber is definitely worth it. 
                            Another plus is that the Wizard loves super 
                            cucumbers.

                        <p>
                            The Luau is a festive beach party that occurs 
                            on the 11th of Summer. The Luau takes place on 
                            the beach, and it's a great opportunity to engage 
                            with the community and contribute to the communal 
                            potluck soup. To participate, head to the beach 
                            between 9am and 2pm. The Governor, who attends 
                            the event, will taste the communal soup, and the 
                            quality of the soup depends on the items contributed 
                            by the townspeople. You'll have the chance to add 
                            an item to the soup to enhance its flavor. Choose 
                            wisely, as the success of the soup affects everyone's 
                            mood. Different items have varying effects, and 
                            selecting a well-liked ingredient can lead to 
                            positive reactions from the villagers.

                        <p>
                            The Dance of the Moonlight Jellies is a magical 
                            and tranquil event that takes place on the 28th 
                            of Summer. The event revolves around the 
                            appearance of the rare and beautiful Moonlight 
                            Jellies, luminescent jellyfish that visit Pelican 
                            Town's shores during this time of year.During the 
                            event, the entire town gathers on the beach to marvel 
                            at the Moonlight Jellies as they gracefully glide 
                            through the water. The scene is accompanied by 
                            soothing music, contributing to the serene atmosphere. 
                            Unlike other festivals, the Dance of the Moonlight 
                            Jellies doesn't involve active participation or 
                            tasks for the player. Instead, it's a contemplative 
                            and visually stunning experience that highlights the 
                            game's focus on nature and the changing seasons.
