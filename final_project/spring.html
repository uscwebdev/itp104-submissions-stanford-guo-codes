                            Purchasable for 100g each at Pierre’s 
                            stand during the Egg Festival, strawberry 
                            seeds which grow in strawberries are by far 
                            the most valuable crop to grow during the spring. 
                            You should save up as much money as possible before 
                            the Egg Festival in order to purchase as many 
                            strawberries as possible to earn the most profit. 
                            If planted on the day purchased, strawberries will 
                            generate about 11.67 gold per day.

                        <h2>Fishing</h2>

                        <p>
                            Catfish are by far the most profitable fish to 
                            attempt to catch during the Spring, but they are 
                            also by far the most difficult to catch. New players 
                            should nevertheless attempt to try their best to catch 
                            as many of these as possible as the payout is worth it. 
                            A normal catfish is worth 200 gold, so when it is raining, 
                            head down to the river and try to catch as many as you can!

                        <h2>Egg Festival</h2>

                        <p>
                            The Egg Festival is an exciting annual event that occurs 
                            on the 13th of Spring. As a new player, you'll want to head 
                            to the town square between 9am and 2pm to join in 
                            the festivities. The highlight of the event is the Egg Hunt, 
                            where you, along with other villagers, search for hidden eggs 
                            scattered around Pelican Town. Your character is equipped with 
                            an Egg Basket to collect these eggs. The more eggs you find, 
                            the better the prizes you'll receive. You’ll also be able to 
                            purchase strawberry seeds from Pierre here, which I highly 
                            recommend.

                        <h2>Flower Dance</h2>

                        <p>
                            The Flower Dance is another charming event that takes 
                            place in the Cindersap Forest on the 24th of Spring. 
                            It's a unique celebration centered around dancing 
                            and socializing. You can ask a villager to be your 
                            dance partner during the festival. It's a heartwarming 
                            opportunity to deepen your connections with the 
                            residents of Pelican Town. However, at this point in 
                            the game, it is unlikely that you will have enough hearts 
                            (relationship points) with any bachelor or bachelorette 
                            in order to ask them to dance, so just enjoy the scene 
                            and enjoy the petals!
