                        <h2>Farming</h2>

                        <p>
                            Yielding an average of 18.89 gold per 
                            day, cranberries are one of the most 
                            profitable crops to grow during the fall. 
                            Similar to blueberries, cranberries, on 
                            harvest, also produce more than one berry 
                            per harvest. However, they are quite expensive 
                            to purchase as their seeds are 240 gold each 
                            at Pierre’s. Still, the profit that you earn 
                            from these plants is definitely worth the hole 
                            in your pocket on the first day of the month!

                        <h2>Fishing</h2>

                        <p>
                            Although they aren’t the most profitable 
                            fish to catch during the fall, I personally 
                            believe that these fish are one of the most 
                            valuable fish to catch during the fall as 
                            they can ONLY be found during the fall. They 
                            can be found in the river from 6am to 7pm 
                            every day and are worth 75 gold each. You 
                            can also use salmon to make salmon dinner 
                            in the kitchen, which is loved by Alex and 
                            also makes a delicious meal.

                        <p>
                            The Stardew Valley Fair is an 
                            annual event that takes place 
                            on the 16th of Fall in the game. 
                            As a new player, you'll encounter 
                            this lively fair, which serves as a 
                            fun opportunity to showcase the fruits 
                            of your labor, engage in various activities, 
                            and earn Star Tokens to exchange for valuable 
                            prizes. The primary focus of the fair is the 
                            Grange Display, where you can exhibit up to nine 
                            items that showcase the diversity of your farm 
                            produce and artisan goods. The better the quality 
                            and variety of items you display, the more Star 
                            Tokens you'll earn. You can turn in these Star 
                            Tokens at Pierre’s where you can purchase cosmetics 
                            and decorations as well as a juicy Stardrop!

                        <h2>Spirit's Eve</h2>

                        <p>
                            Spirits' Eve is a special event that 
                            takes place on the 27th of Fall where 
                            you can experience this festival as a 
                            unique combination of Halloween-inspired 
                            festivities and community interaction. One 
                            of the central attractions is the maze, 
                            which opens up during the event. The maze 
                            is filled with various obstacles and creatures, 
                            and navigating it can be both challenging and 
                            rewarding. Be sure to explore the maze to discover 
                            the hidden golden pumpkin!
