                        <h2>Farming</h2>

                        <p>
                            Unlike other seasons, farmers are 
                            unable to plant any crop during the 
                            winter with the exception of winter 
                            seeds. As a result, in order to make 
                            use of your huge farming plot, it is 
                            in your best interest to plant as many 
                            winter seeds as you can. Winter seeds 
                            are a recipe learned at foraging level 
                            7 and take one of each of the winter 
                            foragables to craft. Don’t worry about 
                            using winter foragables to craft these 
                            seeds: you’ll grow them back right away!

                        <h2>Fishing</h2>

                        <p>
                            Found in the mountains between 6am to 7pm, 
                            sturgeon are the most valuable fish during 
                            the winter with each fish worth a minimum of 
                            200 gold. By this time of the year, you should 
                            be a master at fishing so these fish shouldn’t 
                            be a hassle to catch, so take the time to roll 
                            in the dough. Another bright side of sturgeon 
                            is that you can put them in fish ponds where 
                            they can produce caviar! Finally, Willy also 
                            loves sturgeon so you should consider giving 
                            them to him as a gift.

                        <h2>Festival of Ice</h2>

                        <p>
                            The Festival of Ice is a delightful winter event 
                            that takes place on the 8th of Winter. One of the 
                            main attractions is ice fishing, where you can use 
                            a provided fishing rod to catch fish from holes 
                            drilled into the ice. The festival also features a 
                            fishing contest, challenging you to catch as many 
                            fish as you can within a specific time frame. In 
                            addition to ice fishing, there's a particular area 
                            where you can participate in a slingshot mini-game, 
                            aiming to hit targets to earn festival points. These 
                            points can then be exchanged for prizes.

                        <p>
                            The Night Market is a special event in 
                            Stardew Valley that takes place during 
                            the winter season. As a new player, you 
                            can experience the Night Market from the 
                            15th to the 17th of Winter. This event 
                            transforms the beach into a lively and 
                            illuminated market, offering a unique and 
                            magical atmosphere. A submarine appears during 
                            the Night Market, offering a chance to explore its 
                            depths. Inside, you may find valuable treasures and 
                            unique items. There is also a mermaid boat where 
                            you can enter and watch a mesmerizing mermaid show. 
                            There is also a hidden easter egg there where you can 
                            enter a special code and earn a pearl!

                        <h2>Feast of the Winter Star</h2>

                        <p>
                            The Feast of the Winter Star is a heartwarming 
                            event in Stardew Valley that celebrates the spirit 
                            of giving and community. This festive occasion takes 
                            place on the 25th of Winter and is similar to the 
                            real-world celebration of Christmas. The most notable 
                            event during this festival is the gift exchange. 
                            The player will receive a letter in the mail a week 
                            before the festival on the 18th giving the player a 
                            specific NPC name who the player must prepare a gift 
                            for. In exchange, a random NPC will give the player a 
                            random gift as well. It’s kind of like Secret Santa!
